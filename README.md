## Something Nice

I enjoyed customizing the teleportation and object menu systems. I also enjoyed creating a story around the basic premise of the game.

## Something Not So Nice

There were issues getting SteamVR to work on the latest version of Unity (there is a forum post detailing these issues). It would be nice for known bugs to be broadcast in an email to course participants. In addition, the instructions could have added some detail about the Player Settings and Build steps.
